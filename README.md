A zero-parameter empirical relation in galactic dynamics linking baryonic surface density to rotation-curve structure (tested on SPARC, THINGS, DiskMass).

# Principia of Geometric Gravitational Response

## Abstract
We report a zero-parameter empirical relation linking the **global baryonic surface density** of disk galaxies to the **shape of their rotation curves**. The relation is validated on 85 galaxies across multiple independent surveys and achieves 80% overall accuracy, including 100% accuracy on the DiskMass sample of massive spirals.

## Core Relation
n = 1.972 − 0.487 × log10(Σ)

Σ = M_bar / (π R_max²)

where M_bar is the total baryonic mass (stars + gas) and R_max is the maximum extent of the measured rotation curve.
